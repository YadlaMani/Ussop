# Project Documentation: Ussop

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Ussop project, including its architecture, implementation, testing procedures, results, references, and usability.

## 1. Architecture and Detailed Design

### Overview

Ussop is a **Next.js** application designed to facilitate virtual meetings. It leverages modern web technologies and frameworks to provide a seamless user experience.

### Key Components

- **Frontend Framework**: Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a React-based framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **UI Components**: Utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling and reusable components like `NavBar`, `SideBar`, and `MeetingRoom`.
- **Video SDK**: Integrates the [Stream Video React SDK](https://getstream.io/video/) for real-time video conferencing.
- **State Management**: Uses React hooks and context for managing application state.
- **Routing**: Implements dynamic routing with Next.js' app directory structure.

### Design Highlights

- **Modular Layouts**:
  - `RootLayout` wraps the entire application with global providers like `StreamVideoProvider`.
  - `HomeLayout` organizes the homepage with a `NavBar`, `SideBar`, and content sections.
- **Dynamic Meeting Rooms**: Meeting rooms are dynamically generated based on user-specific IDs.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layouts using Tailwind CSS utilities.

## 2. Implementation/Coding

### Key Features

1. **Dynamic Routing**:
   - Example: page.tsx dynamically generates meeting links.
2. **Video Integration**:
   - MeetingRoom.tsx integrates Stream Video SDK for real-time video calls.
3. **Reusable Components**:
   - Components like `CallControls`, `CallParticipantsList`, and `EndCallButton` ensure modularity.
4. **Global Styling**:
   - Tailwind CSS and custom styles in `globals.css`.

### Code Highlights

- **Root Layout**:
  ```tsx
  // filepath: d:\ussop\app\layout.tsx
  export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
    return (
      <ClerkProvider>
        <main>
          <StreamVideoProvider>{children}</StreamVideoProvider>
        </main>
      </ClerkProvider>
    );
  }
  ```
- **Meeting Room Logic**:
  ```tsx
  // filepath: d:\ussop\components\MeetingRoom.tsx
  const CallLayout = () => {
    switch (layout) {
      case "grid":
        return <PaginatedGridLayout />;
      case "speaker-left":
        return <SpeakerLayout participantsBarPosition="left" />;
      default:
        return <SpeakerLayout participantsBarPosition="right" />;
    }
  };
  ```

## 3. Testing Procedures and Test Cases

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Testing**: Focused on individual components like `NavBar`, `SideBar`, and `MeetingRoom`.
- **Integration Testing**: Ensured seamless interaction between components and SDKs.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Validated user flows like joining a meeting, navigating layouts, and interacting with video controls.

### Sample Test Cases

| **Test Case**             | **Expected Result**                                    | **Status** |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| Render `NavBar` component | NavBar should render with all menu items visible.      | ✅         |
| Join a meeting room       | User should be redirected to the correct meeting link. | ✅         |
| Video call functionality  | Video and audio should work without interruptions.     | ✅         |
| Responsive design check   | Layout should adapt to different screen sizes.         | ✅         |
